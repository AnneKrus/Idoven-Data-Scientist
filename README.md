#Data science task
This page has details of the task we'd like you to complete for the data science job offering.

By the time you're reading this, you would have already received a data set from us. It's actual appointment and patient data (sanitized) from Cliniko.

##What to do
We've tried to keep this task as similar to working here as possible. With that in mind, we think you'll know better than us what can be achieved with this. So there's no specific "thing" we want you to find or do. We want you to explore it as you would if you were working here.

We'd like you to analyse it and give us some insights. The insights should be useful and actionable in some way.

Ideally, the insights would help our customers improve their business. Even better if we could alter Cliniko to implement/make use of these in some automated way.

##Timeframe
It would be great if you could have this done within a week. If that's not doable for you, let us know early.

Also, we don't know how long this should take you, but we're not looking to reward the person that spends the most time on it. We believe in working smarter not harder.

##Tips
In case it's helpful, here's some other tips for you:

You can ask questions. This isn't a "bonus points if they ask questions" thing, just that we'll answer what we can if you need us. Like we would when working together.

You can request more information/data, but we'd rather you didn't. If you really need more, let us know, but there'd need to be a compelling reason for it.

##Summary
We want to see what it's like to work with you, and the quality of work you'd produce. This is a chance for both sides to see how that is.

We will be making a decision based on these tests, so do give it your best.

Thanks for giving this a go, we can't wait to see what you come up with.
